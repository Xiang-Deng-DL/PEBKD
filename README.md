# Personalized Education: Blind Knowledge Distillation

This repository is a PyTorch implementation of "Personalized Education: Blind Knowledge Distillation". The pretrained teachers are downloaded from [SSKD]. You can also download from [pretrained teachers].

## Requirements

The code was tested on
```
Python 3.6
torch 1.2.0
torchvision 0.4.0
```

## Training
To train small students from scratch by distilling knowledge from teacher networks with PE, first download the pretrained teachers into the "pretrained_teachers" folder, and then simply run the command below:<br>`sh train.sh`

## Notes
PE-BKD is a general framework. You can design **your own prior region** based on the prior knowledge that you have about your target task.
